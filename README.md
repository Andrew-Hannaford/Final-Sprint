# Final-Sprint
Semester 1 Final Sprint js and JSON

This is my final sprint for the web design, 
created a simple JSON file with some NHL goalie stats.
Then used the stats to calculate new additional stats and 
displayed some JSON stats and the new calculated stats in the console log.
Tried to make it nice looking added some minor formatting to show only expected decimal places.
