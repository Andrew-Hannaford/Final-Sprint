# Final-Sprint
Semester 1 Final Sprint js and JSON

this is my final sprint for the web design 
created a simple JSON file with some NHL goalie stats 
then used the stats to calculate new additional stats 
displayed some JSON stats and the new calculated stats in the console log 
tried to make it nice looking added some minor formatting to show only expected decimal places
